# Personal blog page

Developed as part of my web development coursework, this blog application allows users to manage articles: adding, modifying, and deletingâ€”via an admin interface post-login. 
The UI is simple yet modern, with responsive design as a key focus. Articles are paginated and can be filtered by their titles for a straightforward user experience.

## Used technologies

### Backend:
- Express
- Bcrypt.js
- JWT (jsonwebtoken)
- Mongoose (for intreacting with MongoDB)
- Other dependencies:
    - cookie-parser (reading cookies coming from a client)
    - multer (image saving)
    - cors
    - express-async-handler
    - dotenv (env vars)

### Frontend:
- Next.js
- TailwindCSS
- Other dependencies:
